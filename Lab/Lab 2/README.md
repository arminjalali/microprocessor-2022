# Lab 2
The input keypad and serial communication
## Purpose
1. Connecting a simple matrix keypad to the microcontroller as the user interface for inputting data
2. Setting up a virtual terminal and getting acquainted with serial communications
## Components
1. Arduino Mega 2560
2. Matrix keypad
3. LED
4. Virtual terminal
5. Oscilloscope
## Discussion
1. In the first part, we connect 9 LEDs to the Arduino Mega 2560 board and the user presses a number on the matrix keypad and the same number of LEDs light up from left to right.
2. In the second part, we connect a virtual terminal and an oscilloscope to the circuit, and each character that is pressed on the matrix keypad, is printed in the terminal. the signals that sent to the terminal are also checked on a oscilloscope
3. In the third part of this experiment, the user inputs a number between 0 and 9 in the virtual terminal and the same number of LEDs light up from left to right, otherwise the expression "invalid number" is printed.
